# Coding-Challenges-Python

In progress

This program was created first as a way to document the most common Python challenges for a job interview. Later I decided instead to turn this repo into a game while teaching english abroad. I feared my Python knowledge may get rusty so it'd be best to build a program that had me solving coding challenges. This program randomly selects 7 of the most common challenges for the user to solve. It then times them based on selected difficulty level. Also when I miss too many days of practice the challenges weaken.
